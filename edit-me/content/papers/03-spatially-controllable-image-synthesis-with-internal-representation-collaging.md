We introduced two GAN‐based editing operations that allow semantic edits over arbitrary image regions: (1) spatial conditional batch normalization with user‐specified weight maps and (2) feature‐blending on intermediate representations. Our approach works with any GAN with conditional normalization layers, can be used to edit both synthetic and real images, and is validated across multiple datasets and architectures. Code available [here](https://github.com/quolc/neural-collage).
