We explored GAN‐based generation of anime faces by curating a clean, specialized dataset and applying DRAGAN regularization to stabilize training. 
Quantitative evaluations and case studies demonstrate high‐quality, diverse outputs. 
Our pretrained models are deployed [here](https://make.girls.moe/#/) with a web UI for interactive design.
