Nonlinear blend modes (e.g., overlay, multiply) enable rich visual effects but lack fast algorithms to decompose existing bitmaps into editable semi-transparent layers. We introduce a neural-network-based method that splits an image into linear and nonlinear alpha layers based on user-specified palettes and blend modes. Our approach runs 370Ã— faster than the state-of-the-art iterative optimization method while matching or surpassing its reconstruction quality.
