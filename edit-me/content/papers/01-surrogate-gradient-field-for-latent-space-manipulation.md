We proposed the first method that enables latent‚Äêspace manipulation in generative adversarial networks under multidimensional conditions (e.g., keypoints, captions). Specifically, we designed an algorithm that searches for a new latent code that satisfies the target condition based on the Surrogate Gradient Field induced by an auxiliary mapping network. We also introduced a disentanglement metric for quantitative comparison, and demonstrated that our method achieved higher disentanglement across tasks including facial attribute editing and complex condition modalities.
